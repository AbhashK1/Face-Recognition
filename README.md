# Face Detection & Recognition System

This is a Face Detection & Recognition System built with Java using JavaCV. The application utilizes various face detection and recognition algorithms, including OpenCV, Haar classifiers, Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH), Eigenfaces, and Fisherfaces.

## Features

- Face Detection: Detect faces in images or live video streams using Haar classifiers.
- Face Recognition: Perform face recognition using LBPH, Eigenfaces, or Fisherfaces algorithms.
- Training: Train the system by providing a dataset of labeled face images.
- User Interface: Java-based UI for easy interaction and control.

## Technologies Used

- Java: Programming language for the backend logic and UI implementation.
- JavaCV: Java interface for OpenCV, providing access to OpenCV's computer vision algorithms.
- OpenCV: Library for computer vision and machine learning algorithms.
- Haar Classifiers: Pre-trained classifiers for object detection, including face detection.
- LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram): Face recognition algorithm based on local texture patterns.
- Eigenfaces: Face recognition algorithm using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Fisherfaces: Face recognition algorithm using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
